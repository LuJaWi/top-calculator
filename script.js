// Create a script that writes each number key press to the first index in an array

// Multiple number key presses should concatenate that key with previous entries to build larger numbers

// When an operation key is pressed, 
// iterate to the next index position and save the operation type

// When "=" is pressed, perform the operation on the two sets of numbers, display the results
// and clear the holder array

// If a number, an operator, and a number are followed by another operator, write the output
// of the first operation set to the display and write the
// output to the first array position and repeat the previous steps until "=" is pressed.
